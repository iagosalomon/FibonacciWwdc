/*:
Hi my name is Iago and this is my playground.
It`s music based, using the Fibonacci sequence. This sequence is very especial to me, since it allways  made me fell included with nature and the universe and always seams to apear in my life one way or another.

 
My icon is the f-clef wich can be made with the Fibonacci spiral and two dots.

 
This playground is meant to be used with the iPad in landscape orientation and in book mode, with the description  on the left and the playground in splitscreen but most important this is meant to be a expirience so just relax,have fun and let the music and your imagination take you away.
